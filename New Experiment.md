## Firefly Measurement Instructions (Succinct)

### 1\. Firefly Handling

- Use **one firefly at a time**.  
- Place it in a **small clear container** (flat, transparent side).  
- Avoid thick, colored, or curved plastic/glass.

### 2\. Positioning

- Aim the **lux meter sensor** directly at the flat wall of the container.  
- Let the firefly settle on that wall with its **light organ roughly facing the sensor**.

### 3\. Distance (Critical)

Measure from: **front of lux meter sensor → inner surface of the container wall**.

Distances required:

- **10 cm**  
- **2–3 cm** (choose an exact value and write it down)

Use a ruler/tape measure.

### 4\. Dark Room

- Room must be **as dark as you can**.  
- Before starting, point the meter into darkness and confirm it reads **\~0.0 lux**.

### 5\. Lux Meter Settings

- Units: **Lux**  
- Range: **Auto** or **lowest manual range** (0.1-lux steps visible)  
- Meter samples at 2/s, so capture many flashes.

For each distance:

- Let the firefly flash **10–20 times**.  
- Record the **highest lux value** seen.

### 6\. Reference Light (COB keychain)

Once per night:

- Place the COB light at a **fixed distance** (e.g. 30 cm).  
- Use one mode (e.g. **High**).  
- Record stabilized lux value:  
  “COB, High, 30 cm → XXX lux”.

### 7\. Notes to Include

- Date \+ local time  
- Location (state/region)  
- Approx. temperature  
- Distances used  
- Max lux at each distance  
- Meter model

### 8\. Priorities if Uncertain

1. One firefly  
2. Flat transparent wall facing sensor  
3. Distance measured and recorded  
4. Fully dark room

This is all that’s needed for the first dataset.
